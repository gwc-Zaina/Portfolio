 <h2>About me </h2>

  I reside in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and I attend Philadelphia Highschool for Girls.

  I have been involved in coding
  since I was 11 and it has been a great expierence.
  I have a love for many arts like photography and theatre.

  I also play sports. I played
  Ice Hockey for 7 years and I currently play lacrosse.
  I have no idea what I want to do with my life.
  Im considering a field in computer science
